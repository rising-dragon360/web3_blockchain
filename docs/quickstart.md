Quickstart
==========

A [web3j sample project](https://github.com/web3j/sample-project-gradle) is available that demonstrates a number of core features of Ethereum with web3j, including:

-   Connecting to a node on the Ethereum network
-   Loading an Ethereum wallet file
-   Sending Ether from one address to another
-   Deploying a smart contract to the network
-   Reading a value from the deployed smart contract
-   Updating a value in the deployed smart contract
-   Viewing an event logged by the smart contract

[Web3j's command line tools](command_line_tools.md) can be used to create a new project with a simple Greeter solidity contract or import your solidity files.

To get the latest version on Mac OS or Linux, type the following in your terminal :

`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/web3j/web3j-installer/master/web3j.sh | bash`

The commands available can be found in the [Command line tools](command_line_tools.md) of the documentation.
